			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<!-- Horizontal Rule Divider styled with CSS -->
			<hr>
			
			<!-- Being Paragraphs -->

			<p>Charles is inquisitive.  No topic is too boring and no words are too dull, this includes labels!  Charles, or Charlie to everyone, simply can't ignore the rabbit-holes of the web so no topic may go undiscovered ...<em>even those he regrets</em>.</p>

			<p>Charlie's past is littered with regrets.  These ranging from a history degree, a middle grades teaching job and even a master's in education from NCSU for which he's hoplessly in debt.  Today, he can be found studying coding at the UNC-CH Coding Bootcamp where he hopes to finally achieve the American Dream of eating something besides ramen.</p>
